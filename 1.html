<h2> WHAT IF THANOS WASN'T EVIL?</h2>
<h3> Net Art, 2019. (Art 74) </h3>
</font>

<font face="monospace">
<center>
I&#39;ve always believed that there is always something good hidden in every situation, place, person or just anything in life. 
<center>
As human beings, we often encounter different things that brings us down, whether it&#39;s physically, spiritually or mentally.
<center>
I believe that during these worst, painful times-- that&#39;s when we best see the light. The shining light that 
<Center>
could brighten up the pathways that we human beings need to walk on. This light enables us to constantly change,
<center>
constantly move on to heights that could help us be better people. One of my projects from Art 74-- <b>What If 
<center>
Thanos Wasn&#39;t Evil?</b>, depicts Thanos, one of the most hated villains of all time, in a different light. 
<center>
Thanos, an evil creature from the fictional, comic universe of The Avengers, wanted to collect all the infinity
<center>
stones to diminish half the universe. Through this work, I was able to create the opposite outcome he wanted. 
<center>
I created an opposite character who wanted to diminish all the destruction that happens in our world. 
<center>
Art is a very powerful weapon, that could create and change perception. It&#39;s a strong weapon that could be used
<center>
to alter emotions and explore new ideals. I hope that this project creates a new perspective-- that
<center>even the biggest, meanest guy could somewhat change for the better.
