<h2> ANG LUMILIPAD KONG KUBO</h2>

<center>"Home Is Where The Heart Is"---- I truly believe in this phrase. I am Marc Velayo and I am a proud immigrant. 
<center>Moving to this country has blessed me with a lot of great opportunities to live a better life. But, I can't 
<center>help but to miss my home. My humble abode where I was raised, where I dreamt, where I spent countless joyful 
<center>memories with the people I love.
<p>
<center>I used Blender to create a 3D Model of a Bahay Kubo. "A Bahay Kubo is a type of stilt house indigenous to the
<center>cultures of the Philippines." (Wikipedia). I wanted to create a Bahay Kubo because it reminds me of my country. 
<center>It reminds me of the simple life I used to live back in the Philippines. It reminds me of my genuine, kind 
<center>spirited countrymen who always loved and cared for each other.
<p>
<center>A Bahay Kubo is a symbol of unity in the Philippines. It is created with various pieces of bamboo, wood and 
<center>nipa leaves. "The advantage of using lightweight materials in building bahay kubo is that it can easily be moved to <center>another place. If a family decides to transfer to another area within the village, usually their neighbors 
<center>will help them move the house. It is called Bayanihan, an old Filipino tradition of helping each other without 
<center>the need to ask for it in the name of friendship and camaraderie." (Balay.ph).
<p>
<center>This piece, which I titled "Ang Lumilipad Kong Kubo" (My Flying House) is inspired from the Disney movie, Up. 
<center>I wanted to evoke a sense of nostalgia and tie the concept of immigration with a modern twist. I am a fan of 
<center>the movie, Up and I asked myself-- "What if my house just suddenly flew up and got here?". 
<center>I've lived a happy life in the Philippines, but I always dreamt of living a better, stable life. The balloons that 
<center>are tied on to the Bahay Kubo represents my dreams and hopes. They are colored in primary colors- red, blue 
<center>and yellow which represents my country's flag. There are a couple of balloons that
<center>aren't tied in to the house, which represents the relationships and memories I've lost in the process of moving. 
<center>The table inside the Bahay Kubo reminds me of my memories with my family, as we always had our 
<center>meals together at the same time. The candle represents the hope that 
<center>I have that someday I'll be back again.
<p>
<center>A Bahay Kubo will always remind me of my home, my loved ones and myself.

<center>Ang lumilipad kong bahay. Ang lumilipad kong mga pangarap. Ako ay patuloy na lilipad.
<center>(My flying house. My soaring dreams. I will continuously fly.)
