<center>Technology has impacted our lives in a lot of ways. From making the simplest tasks easier 
<center> to connecting every human being around the world. It plays an important role in our 
<center> society-- but it has its own positive and negative effects
<center>that has heavily influenced our way living. It has brought a new way of communication, and the
<center> most common way is through the use of our phones.
<center>We all spend a lot of time on our phones, looking down and not realizing the amount of time 
<center> wasted on social media, games or other forms of distraction that our phones provide.
<center>We forget to look up to the reality of life-- the things that are happening around us, the 
<center> things that was deemed important before. While taking actions on our phones-- swiping up, down, 
<center>left and right, do we still remember to take real action in our lives?
<center>I asked SJSU students around campus to perform in the video. The camera I used was a Canon T6i.
